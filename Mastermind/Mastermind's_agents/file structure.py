Supportive Elements
Configuration Templates

Directory: config_templates/
Files: window_config_template.yaml (Template for window configurations)
Temporary Configurations Directory

Directory: temporary_configs/ or managed within config_templates/ as a temporary directory for storing runtime configurations dynamically generated.
Logging and Data Collection (Planned/Conceptual)

This component involves creating a structured logging system and data collection mechanism. Specific classes and filenames would be determined based on the implementation details discussed, such as an event bus for inter-module communication and a data collector for logging and monitoring.
Summary
This list provides an overview of the core components of your application and where their implementations are located. As your project evolves, you might add more classes, modules, or utilities, so keeping this list updated will help maintain clarity and organization within your development process.

Program Function and Interaction Summary
main.py: Serves as the entry point for the application. It initializes the main GUI window and may set up any necessary application-wide configurations or services.

chatgptgui.py: Contains the MainApplication class that creates the main application window. This script handles user interactions, such as sending messages to ChatGPT and opening new customizable windows. It integrates directly with custom_window.py for spawning new windows and config_manager.py for global configurations.

custom_window.py: Defines the Window class, representing a customizable window within the application. Each instance can have its own configuration for appearance and behavior, managed through config_manager.py. Windows can be named and renamed, with corresponding configuration files created and deleted dynamically.

config_manager.py: Manages configuration files for the application, including creating unique configurations for each Window instance based on a template (window_config_template.yaml). It handles the lifecycle of these configurations, such as creating them in a temporary directory and cleaning up upon window closure.

config_templates/window_config_template.yaml: Serves as the default configuration template for new windows. config_manager.py uses this template to generate individual configuration files.

utils/file_handler.py and command_executor.py: Provide utility functions for document processing and executing system commands, respectively. These can be invoked from anywhere in the application, such as within Window instances for specific functionalities like displaying file content or running commands in response to user input.

Temporary Directory (temporary_configs/): Stores the dynamically created configuration files for each Window instance. Managed by config_manager.py, this directory ensures configurations are isolated per window and are cleaned up when no longer needed.

This structure and summary outline a modular application that leverages dynamic configuration management to create a flexible and interactive user interface. Each script has a defined role, facilitating maintenance and future expansion. The use of a configuration manager to handle window-specific settings introduces a layer of customization, allowing for a rich user experience.
