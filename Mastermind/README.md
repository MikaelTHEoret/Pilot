Given the nature of web applications and the information from the README, the review order should prioritize understanding the flow of the application from starting the server to serving the requests. Here's a list of files and directories in a logical order for review:

package.json - To check scripts and dependencies before starting the server.
server.js - As it's the entry point for starting the server.
.env - To verify environment variables (not directly accessible but important for configuration).
app.js - To understand the setup of middleware and initial route handling.
webpack.config.js - To know how assets are being bundled and served.
public/ - To review static assets that are served, such as the index.html.
routes/ - To analyze how different routes are structured and handled.
routes/welcomeRouter.js - If exists, as it likely handles the root path.
routes/authRoutes.js - For authentication-related routes, if they exist.
routes/errorRoutes.js - To see how errors are handled.
Other route handlers - Review these for additional functionality.
controllers/ - To understand the logic behind route actions.
models/ - To review data models, starting with User.js for user management.
services/ - To understand the business logic or service layer.
utils/ - For utility functions that support various operations.
views/ - To see how the views are being rendered, starting with index.ejs or similar.
public/css/ - To inspect styles that could affect rendering.
tsconfig.json - For TypeScript configuration if TypeScript is used in the project.
nodemon.json - For development convenience settings related to automatic restarts.
Once we've reviewed these files, it should give us a comprehensive understanding of how the application is structured and operates, which could lead us to potential issues with routing or page display.


AI-assisted coding platform with a chat GPT interface.

## Overview

The app is a web application using Node.js with Express framework. It integrates AI capabilities for coding assistance and customization. The project structure includes routes, services, models, views, and configuration files.

## Features

- Chat Interface for interactive coding
- Local Project Development
- AI-Assisted Coding with GPT model
- GPT-Builder Feature for customizing AI behavior
- File Upload for review by AI

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Node.js
- MongoDB

### Quickstart

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the .env file
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Start the server with `npm start`

Enhanced Mastermind Project Guide Map with Critical Code Information
Root Directory: Mastermind/
app.js: Initializes the Express application and middleware.
Uses express.json() for body parsing.
Registers routes:
/welcome using welcomeRouter.
Error handling routes through errorRoutes.
Includes a general error handling middleware.
server.js: Configures and starts the server.
Sets up database connection with mongoose to process.env.DATABASE_URL.
Configures session handling with express-session and MongoStore, secured with process.env.SESSION_SECRET.
Uses ejs as the view engine and serves static files from the public directory.
Includes route handling for authentication (authRoutes) and a base route (/) rendering the index view.
Implements custom middleware to track session views and output session creation/access times.
Error handling for server errors and unhandled application errors.
Listens on process.env.PORT or 3001.
Directories:
controllers/:
Key functionality is handling specific application logic tied to routes.
models/:
User.js: Defines the schema for user data, critical for authentication and user management.
public/css/:
Contains styles that are essential for the visual presentation of the application.
